# Brewsci/science (legacy)

This tap provided scientific formulae for both the Homebrew and Linuxbrew package managers.

This tap is not maintained. We are not accepting new pull requests, except to migrate a formula to [Homebrew/core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core), [Brewsci/bio](https://github.com/brewsci/homebrew-bio), or a different tap within the [Brewsci organization](https://github.com/brewsci). Please open an issue if you are interested in creating and maintaining a new tap within the Brewsci organization.
